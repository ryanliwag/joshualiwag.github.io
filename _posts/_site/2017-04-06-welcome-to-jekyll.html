<p>Accenture also hosted a forecasting challenge in which I had no interest in, until I saw it had a cash prize of 60,000 pesosâ€¦ WTF, I am in.</p>

<p>First time for me doing a time-series forecast, so I kind of know my limitations in where I should be devoting my effort. I dont know shit about diagnosing timeseries data and what correspoding model to use. I dont know how to interpret different time-series model such as arima, sarima or VEC, or how they work (yikes). Alas this has forced me to use the most blackboxy abstract model to which I am very familiar with and that is neural netowrks. This give me the added benefit of handling multivariate data which would let me add more features. The dataset used is the same one I gathered in my [visualization project]https://ryanliwag.github.io/Visualizing-MRT-2017/</p>
