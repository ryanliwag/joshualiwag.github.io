      <p>Philippines 2017 MRT Foot traffic Visualization made using D3. This was my entry for the Data Visualization category for Accenture’s big data challenge. you can view the graphs <a href="https://ryanliwag.github.io/datachallenge_vis_2018.github.io/">here</a>
This was also my first time using D3 and javascript in general. And its also my first shot at data visualization. I try to summarize in this post the process I have taken to build my first ever visualization using d3 and my shortcoming in what I could have done better. I definitely learned a lot, during the process and I think I can do much better next time a challenge like this comes around.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-the-data">Gathering the Data</h2>

<p>So before any visualization is to occur, I needed to first gather the necessary data. Open data Philippines sadly only gives mrt data which is 2015 and below. So I opted to request data from eFOI Philippines and I asked for all data from 2015 till 2017. 2 weeks passed before I got the data, but what a fucking surprise, it’s in excel format. The excel file was configured to their own style, and it was terrifying. Nonetheless, after some work I managed to get the mrt data into a csv format, additional data such as MRT issues, I managed to scrape them off MRT website. Followed by some pandas manipulation for data cleaning and handling missing data.
I have never done javascript in my life, so I figured this is a good chance to have a go at it. The main reason I wanted to try D3, is just because people said it was kind of hard to learn (I am a masochist, so let’s GO). It took me a couple of days to get acclimated to javascript, but its a lot like python so I guess that’s good.</p>

<h2 id="building-my-first-d3-graphs">Building my first D3 Graphs</h2>

<p>When It came to the visualizing the data, my first dumbass thought is how could I present as much data as possible into an interactive chart, that would also serve as a seemless UI that would hopefully be natural to interact with.</p>

<p>Key points I want to Visualize in my first Graph</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project total entries and exits using a calendar heatmap z</li>
  <li>Turn the big calendar heat map into interactive buttons</li>
  <li>The interactive buttons will display bar charts that can show data on each station</li>
  <li>Then add extra buttons to toggle interesting events such as mrt issues/breakdowns or Holidays</li>
</ul>

<p>After compiling what I want to visualize, I followed a typical color scheme to try and make it look passable. When visualizing the traffic throughout the year, I used a calendar heatmap to give a view of the total foot traffic. I don’t know why, but during the time I thought it would be useful to add a side by side bar chart so that when you click on the calendar heat map it can give you a breakdown of the number of people entering and exiting a station. Hovering over the elements in the heatmap also gives additional details displayed by a tooltip.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/project-train-vis-2017/train_calendar_heatmap_2.png" alt="calendar_heatmap" /></p>

<p>The second graph I made, I wanted it to display what the average hourly traffic on each station. This was pretty simple, there is a simple slider whose value is pulled by a d3 function displaying the graph. The stopping motion of the slider to display values kind of irks me but I guess this will have to do since I also don’t have a lot of time.</p>

<h2 id="shortcoming-and-learnings">Shortcoming and Learnings</h2>

<p>I learned a lot about how to use d3 ( such as chaining arguments and nesting data ). I am honestly not too happy with the results and it’s already too late when I realized it. This visualization I made sadly doesn’t tell any story. I was too focused on making it interactive, where interactivity might have been a mistake in the first place. Its cool and fancy, but it seems too much interactivity gives the user too much freedom and no clear direction to a story you want to tell. AHHHHHH, I should try harder the next time an opportunity to do visualization arrises.</p>
