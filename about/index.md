I don't expect anyone to read this...

Main reasoning for this website is to brush on certain topics I want to learn (trying to apply that Feynman Technique). I wanna write about Machine learning, Computer vision and Algorithms in general. I want to write on these topics so that I am forced to fill the holes or gaps in my understanding of the topic. I want to understand the idea behind these topics completely, not just create application but understand theory.

I am aiming to write atleast 2 posts per week and 1 small application. Holding myself accountable for this. Hah

Things on my list: 
* Gradient Descent / Backpropgration
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Generative adversial network (GAN)
* Colorizing anime using GAN (Application)
* A project involving Reinforcment learning (Unity perhaps)

Things I like
  * ANIME & MANGA
  * Games (I try to play when I have the time)
  * Probably machine learning or atleast the general field of AI

Things I hate?
 * unskippable video ads
 * politics

All other things I tolerate ... Including people
